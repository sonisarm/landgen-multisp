## Code for publication "Multi-species landscape genetics to inform territorial planning"

The repository accompanies a multi-species landscape genetics study of eight high-mountain endemic plants from Teide and Caldera de Taburiente National Parks in the Canary Islands. The paper aims to (i) characterise environmental niches and habitat suitability, (ii) compare fine-scale spatial genetic structure between short- and long-distance seed dispersers, (iii) assess how topography and climate shape genetic differentiation, and (iv) identify present and future connectivity corridors under climate change. Methodologically, it combines polyploid-aware microsatellite analyses, population genetic structure (STRUCTURE, TESS3, DAPC), fine-scale spatial genetic structure (Sp statistic), environmental PCA to explore their environment, species distribution modelling (BIOMOD2), and optimised resistance surface modelling (ResistanceGA) to link genetic patterns with topo-climatic gradients and forecast connectivity under future climate scenarios.

The following diagram provides an overview of the workflow for the analysis performed. The highlighted steps correspond to those for which code is included in this GitHub repository, and the analysis code is organized within the respective folders.
